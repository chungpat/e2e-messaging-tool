Using SHA256 as hashing algorithm
No need to personally encrypt or hash password when sending over HTTPS, already encrypted since client-server communication uses TLS 
Successfully registration generates a unique salt which is concatenated to the already hashed password and then hashing it again. This is then stored in the database along with the user unique salt.
Logging in basically repeats the same process but checks it with the already stored password in the database
User session tracked using a variable which stores the current user

Friends list is just every registered user in the database except the logged in user
Friends list shows empty if not logged in ("No Friends :(")

Passphrase for myCA.key: INFO2222project


Make login sessions instead of having just one
Right now login sessions are overridden on different devices
Store message history in encrypted fashion

Make host server public
Set hostname to 0.0.0.0
Connect using https://{ip address}:{portnumber}
Connect on host using {127.0.0.1}:{port number}
